## ABOUT
This system administration project focuses on setting up a secure virtual machine. It covers key topics such as virtualization, partitioning, LVM, command-line tools, SSH, and system security measures like sudo, firewalls, and password policies. The project repository includes a script for automated tasks and the virtual machine signature.

## MANDATORY
> During the evaluation, I was asked questions about the topics below.
- [x] Choose between two Linux-based operating systems: `Rocky` or `Debian`.
- [x] Create at least 2 encrypted partitions using `LVM`.
- [x] Ensure `SSH services` are running on specific ports.
- [x] Configure a `UFW firewall` and leave only port `4242` open.
- [x] Set up the `hostname` (will be changed during evaluation) and a strong `password policy` for all users.
- [x] Set up a strong `sudo` configuration.
- [x] Create a `monitoring script` that displays specific information every 10 minutes at server startup.

## BONUS
> During the evaluation, also had to justify my choices.
- [x] Set up a different partition structure.
- [x] Set up a functional `WordPress` website with the following services: `lighttpd`, `MariaDB` and `PHP`.
- [x] Set up a service of my own choice that I think is useful (justify that choice).

## NORMINETTE
